However, Python's dynamic typing and use of names as references to objects, rather than directly storing values, make its naming system particularly important to understand.">name</a>.

<p>When you <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, define refers to the act of creating a new variable, function, class, or module. | This is done by assigning a value to a variable, creating a function with the def keyword, creating a class with the class keyword, or importing a module with the import keyword. Defining an entity in Python allows you to give it a name and specify its behavior, which can then be used and reused throughout your code.">define</a> a variable it becomes either <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8804" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'global' is a keyword used to declare a variable as global, meaning it can be accessed and modified from within a function. | By default, variables created inside a function are local, and cannot be accessed from outside the function. The 'global' keyword allows a function to access and modify global variables, which can be useful for sharing data between functions or maintaining state. However, it's generally recommended to avoid using global variables when possible, as they can make code harder to understand and debug due to their wide scope.">global</a></strong> or <strong>local</strong>. If a variable is defined at the top-level of the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6057" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A module in Python is a file containing Python definitions and statements. | It helps in organizing and reusing code by allowing you to load it from other modules or scripts. Modules can be loaded using the import statement. A simple module written for direct execution is often called a script. The primary difference between a module and a script is in their usage; modules are loaded from other modules or scripts, while scripts are executed directly.">module</a> it is considered global. That means that you can refer to this variable from every code block in your program. Global variables can be useful when you need to share state information or some configuration between different <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. | It is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and the code block. Functions can take zero or more arguments, and they can return one or more values. They help in breaking down large programs into smaller and manageable tasks, making the code more readable and maintainable. Functions can be used to encapsulate complex logic, making it easier to test and debug.">functions</a>. For example, you can store the name of a current user in a global variable and then use it where needed. It makes your code easier to change: in order to set a new user name you will only have to change a single variable.</p>
<p>Local variables are created when you define them in the body of a function. So its name can only be resolved inside the current function's scope. It lets you avoid issues with side-effects that may happen when using global variables.</p>
<p>Consider the example to see the difference between global and local variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">phrase = "Let it be"

def global_printer():
    print(phrase)  # we can use phrase because it's a global variable

global_printer()  # Let it be is printed
print(phrase)  # we can also print it directly

phrase = "Hey Jude"

global_printer()  # Hey Jude is now printed because we changed the value of phrase

def printer():
    local_phrase = "Yesterday"
    print(local_phrase)  # local_phrase is a local variable

printer()  # Yesterday is printed as expected

print(local_phrase)  # NameError is raised</code></pre>
<p>Thus, a global variable can be accessed both from the top-level of the module and the function's body. On the other hand, a local variable is only visible inside the nearest scope and cannot be accessed from the outside.</p>
<h5 id="legb-rule" style="text-align: center;">LEGB rule</h5>
<p>A variable resolution in Python follows the <strong>LEGB rule</strong>. That means that the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6047" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The interpreter in Python is a layer of software logic that executes your code, translating it line by line. | It's part of the standard Python installation package. When you write larger programs, it's more efficient to prepare your code in advance using a text editor and then run it with the interpreter.

The interpreter is responsible for translating your code into a form that the hardware can understand and execute.">interpreter</a> looks for a name in the following <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10059" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, order is the sequence or arrangement in which operations or elements are processed or organized. | In terms of operations, Python follows a left-to-right operation convention, similar to mathematics, where operations are performed in a specific sequence, such as parentheses, exponentiation, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction, also known as the order of operations. In terms of data structures like lists, order refers to the position of elements within the structure, where each element has an index that corresponds to its position. This order is maintained unless explicitly altered through programming methods or operations.">order</a>:</p>

<p>Let's consider an example to illustrate the LEGB rule:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = "global"
def outer():
    x = "outer local"
    def inner():
        x = "inner local"
        def func():
            x = "func local"
            print(x)
        func()
    inner()

outer()  # "func local"</code></pre>
<p>When the <code class="language-python">print()</code> function inside the <code class="language-python">func()</code> is called the interpreter needs to resolve the name <code class="language-python"><samp>x</samp></code>. It'll first look at the innermost variables and will search for the local definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> in <code class="language-python">func()</code> function. In the case of the code above, the interpreter will find the local <code class="language-python">x</code> in <code class="language-python">func()</code> successfully and print its value, <code class="language-python">'func local'</code>. <a href="https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=x%20%3D%20%22global%22%0Adef%20outer%28%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20x%20%3D%20%22outer%20local%22%0A%20%20%20%20def%20inner%28%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20x%20%3D%20%22inner%20local%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20def%20func%28%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20x%20%3D%20%22func%20local%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20print%28x%29%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20func%28%29%0A%20%20%20%20inner%28%29%0A%0Aouter%28%29%20%20%23%20%22func%20local%22&amp;cumulative=false&amp;curInstr=0&amp;heapPrimitives=nevernest&amp;mode=display&amp;origin=opt-frontend.js&amp;py=3&amp;rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&amp;textReferences=false" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Here</a> is the visualization of the code. Check it out to see how it works almost in real-time!</p>
<p>But what if there isn't a definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> in <code class="language-python">func()</code>? Then, the interpreter will move outward and turn to <code class="language-python">inner()</code> function. Check out the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = "global"
def outer():
    x = "outer local"
    def inner():
        x = "inner local"
        def func():
            print(x)
        func()
    inner()

outer()  # "inner local"</code></pre>
<p>As you see, the name <code class="language-python">x</code> was resolved in <code class="language-python">inner()</code> function, since the value <code class="language-python">"inner local"</code> was printed. </p>
<p>If we remove the definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> from the <code class="language-python">inner()</code> function as well and run the code again, the interpreter will continue the search among the <code class="language-python">outer()</code> locals in the same fashion. If we keep deleting the lines of code defining <code class="language-python">x</code>, the interpreter will move on to <code class="language-python">outer()</code> locals, then globals, and then built-in names. In case there is no matching built-in name, an error will be raised. Look at the example where the global definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> is reached by the interpreter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = "global"
def outer():
    def inner():
        def func():
            print(x)
        func()
    inner()

outer()  # "global"</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget about LEGB rule if you plan on using enclosing functions. </p>
<h5 id="keywords-nonlocal-and-global" style="text-align: center;">Keywords "nonlocal" and "global"</h5>
<p>We already mentioned one way to assign a global variable: make a definition at the top-level of a module. But there is also a special keyword <code class="language-python">global</code> that allows us to declare a variable global inside a function's body.</p>
<p>You can't change the value of a global variable inside the function without using the <code class="language-python">global</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 1
def print_global():
    print(x)

print_global()  # 1

def modify_global():
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

modify_global()  # UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment, line 8</code></pre>
<p>The error is raised because to execute <code class="language-python">print(x)</code> on the 8th line, the interpreter tries to resolve <code class="language-python">x</code> and finds it in the <em>local</em> scope – the local <code class="language-python">x</code> is declared on the next, 9th, line, i.e. after its use on line 8, so the interpreter raises the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6052" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An error in Python is a problem that occurs while the program is running, which prevents it from executing correctly. | These issues are usually caused by logical mistakes in the code, and they can be identified by the error messages that Python displays. These messages often include details about the type of error, the location in the code where it occurred, and sometimes even a suggested fix. Understanding and addressing these errors is a crucial part of the programming process, as they can provide valuable insights into how the code is functioning and where improvements can be made.">error</a>. However, if we removed line 8, the same would happen. In that case, to execute <code class="language-python">x = x + 1</code>, the interpreter would need to compute the expression <code class="language-python">x + 1</code> and resolve the variable <code class="language-python">x</code> in it, however, it is declared in the same line (remember, the interpreter checks the local scope first). Since its value would be needed before it had actually been computed, the interpreter would raise the same error: <code class="language-python">UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment</code>. To fix this error, we need to declare <code class="language-python">x</code> global:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 1
def global_func():
    global x
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

global_func()  # 1
global_func()  # 2
global_func()  # 3</code></pre>
<p>When <code class="language-python">x</code> is global you can increment its value <strong>inside</strong> the function.</p>
<p><code class="language-python">nonlocal</code> keyword lets us assign to variables in the outer (but not global) scope:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def func():
    x = 1
    def inner():
        x = 2
        print("inner:", x)
    inner()
    print("outer:", x)

def nonlocal_func():
    x = 1
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = 2
        print("inner:", x)
    inner()
    print("outer:", x)

func()  # inner: 2
        # outer: 1

nonlocal_func()  # inner: 2
                 # outer: 2</code></pre>
<p>Though <code class="language-python">global</code> and <code class="language-python">nonlocal</code> are present in the language, they are not often used in practice, because these keywords make programs less predictable and harder to understand.</p>
<h5 id="why-do-we-need-scopes" style="text-align: center;">Why do we need scopes?</h5>
<p>Python distinguishes between global and local scopes to enhance code organisation. Global scope allows retaining information between function calls, aiding data transfer and communication in complex processes like multithreading. However, if all the declarations were stored in a global scope, the namespace would be extremely clogged up and hard to navigate, which may lead to confusion and bugs. Therefore Python saves you the trouble by allowing you to "isolate" some variables from the rest of the code when you split it into functions.</p>
