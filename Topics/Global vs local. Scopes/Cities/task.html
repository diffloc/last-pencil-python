<h2>Cities</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>Imagine you have made a program that plays the cities game with a user. To make the game work, you need to remember the user's city and be able to change it. Here is the code that achieves this. However, if you run it as it is now, you will face an error: you cannot access the variable <code class="java">user_city</code> from outside of the function. To solve this issue, just add <em>one line</em>. Remember not to change any <em>other</em> part of the code.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
