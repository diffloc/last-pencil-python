<h2>Function, arguments and parameters</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>By now, you are on good terms with <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. | It is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and the code block. Functions can take zero or more arguments, and they can return one or more values. They help in breaking down large programs into smaller and manageable tasks, making the code more readable and maintainable. Functions can be used to encapsulate complex logic, making it easier to test and debug.">functions</a>, since you know how to <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5891" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In the context of Python, 'invoke' means to call or execute a function. | When you invoke a function, you write its name followed by parentheses, which may contain arguments (values used inside the function body). The function is then executed, and it may return a result or perform some action.">invoke</a> and declare them. Let's deepen your knowledge a bit and discover some new features of functions.</p>
<p>First, a line should be drawn between the terms <strong>"argument"</strong> and <strong>"<a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a parameter is a variable that is used as a placeholder in a function definition to specify an argument that the function can accept. | It is defined in the function signature and can have a default value. When a function is called, the arguments passed in the function call are assigned to the corresponding parameters. Parameters with default values will take on that default value if no argument is passed for that parameter in the function call. Parameters allow functions to be flexible and accept different inputs while maintaining a consistent structure.">parameter</a>"</strong>. Parameters represent what a function accepts, it's those names that appear in the function definition. Meanwhile, arguments are the values we pass to a function when <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7665" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, call is a term used to describe the act of invoking or using a function or method. | When you call a function, you're essentially asking Python to execute the code inside that function, often passing in some arguments to be used within the function's body. This allows for code reuse and modularity, making your programs more organized and easier to understand.">calling</a> it. We'll cover both arguments and parameters further.</p>
<h5 id="positional-arguments" style="text-align: center;">Positional arguments</h5>
<p>There are different ways to <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/37669" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'assign' refers to the process of giving a value to a variable. | This is a fundamental concept in programming, as variables allow you to store and manipulate data. In Python, you can assign values to variables using the equals sign (=). For example:

```
x = 5
```

In this case, the value 5 is assigned to the variable x. Python creates a new object, places the value 5 inside the object, and then creates a reference from the variable name x to the object.">assign</a> arguments to a function. First of all, you can do it simply by <strong>position</strong>. In this case, values will associate with parameters in the order in which you passed them into your function <strong>from left to right</strong>. Such arguments are called <strong>positional</strong>, or <strong>non-keyword</strong>. </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y


subtract(11, 4)  # 7
subtract(4, 11)  # -7</code></pre>
<p>When we swapped the numbers in the second function call, we got a different result. Thus, you can see that the order determines how arguments are assigned.</p>
<h5 id="named-arguments" style="text-align: center;">Named arguments</h5>
<p>Another way to assign arguments is by <strong>name</strong>. Sometimes you might want to control the order of passed values. That's where <strong>named</strong>, or <strong>keyword</strong>, arguments come into play.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet(name, surname):
    print("Hello,", name, surname)


# Non-keyword arguments
greet("Willy", "Wonka")               # Hello, Willy Wonka

# Keyword arguments
greet(surname="Wonka", name="Willy")  # Hello, Willy Wonka</code></pre>
<p>The order doesn't matter here since parameters are matched by name. However, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/18505" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Keyword arguments in Python are parameters that are assigned values using their names in the function call, such as function(parameter=value). | This allows for clearer code and better readability, as it explicitly associates the value with the parameter name. Keyword arguments are optional and can be used in any order, making them highly flexible for function calls. They are defined in the function definition with a default value, which is used if the argument is not provided during the function call.">keyword arguments</a> are always written <strong>after</strong> non-keyword arguments when you call a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">greet("Frodo", surname="Baggins")  # Hello, Frodo Baggins
greet(name="Frodo", "Baggins")     # SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to mention each parameter <strong>once</strong>. To understand why this is important, let's think about what happens every time we call a function. In fact, arguments are initialized so that all operations with the values in this function start from scratch. You cannot initialize an argument twice, so if a value has already been passed and associated with some parameter, attempts to assign another value to this name will fail.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet(name, surname):
    print("Hello,", name, surname)


greet("Clementine", name="Rose")
# TypeError: greet() got multiple values for argument 'name'</code></pre>
<p>As shown in the example, multiple values for the same name cause an error.</p>
<h5 id="names-are-important" style="text-align: center;">Names are important</h5>
<p>We have covered the main errors that you can face. Of course, there can be more parameters in a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def responsibility(developer, tester, project_manager, designer):
    print(developer, "writes code")
    print(tester, "tests the system")
    print(project_manager, "manages the product")
    print(designer, "develops design")</code></pre>
<p>Note that when we use keyword arguments, names are important, not positions. Thus, the following example will work correctly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">responsibility(project_manager="Sara", developer="Abdul", tester="Yana", designer="Mark")
# Abdul writes code
# Yana tests the system
# Sara manages the product
# Mark develops design</code></pre>
<p>However, if we call the function with the same order of names, but without <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5891" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A named argument in Python is a type of argument that is passed to a function with a specified name, allowing for clear and organized code. | Unlike positional arguments, which are assigned based on their order, named arguments are assigned based on their names, providing flexibility and reducing the risk of errors due to incorrect argument order. This naming convention enhances readability and maintainability, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose and functionality of each argument.">named arguments</a>, then the output will be wrong, with mixed responsibilities:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">responsibility("Sara", "Abdul", "Yana", "Mark")
# Sara writes code
# Abdul tests the system
# Yana manages the product
# Mark develops design</code></pre>
<p>This way, Python knows the names of the arguments that our function takes. We can ask Python to remind us about them using the built-in <code class="language-python">help()</code> function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">help(responsibility)
# Help on function responsibility in module __main__:
# responsibility(developer, tester, project_manager, designer)</code></pre>
<h5 id="pep-time" style="text-align: center;">PEP time</h5>
<p>Look at the declared function and function calls shown in this topic one more time: <code class="language-python">greet(name="Willy", surname="Wonka")</code>. Have you noticed missing spaces around the equality sign? Their absence is not accidental. By <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PEP 8 convention</a>, you should not put spaces around <code class="language-python">=</code> when indicating a keyword argument.</p>
<h5 id="summary" style="text-align: center;">Summary</h5>
<p>Now that we've discussed some advanced features of functions, let's sum it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a distinction between <strong>parameters </strong>and <strong>arguments</strong>.</li>
<li>You can pass arguments to a function by <strong>position </strong>and by <strong>name</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>order</strong> of declared <strong>parameters </strong>is important, as well as the <strong>order of arguments</strong> passed into a function.</li>
